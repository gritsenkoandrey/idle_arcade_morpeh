# Idle Arcade
## An idle arcade game built with Unity 6, leveraging a high-performance, modular architecture powered by:

### Morpeh ECS — fast, cache-friendly entity-component system
### VContainer — compile-time dependency injection
### LitMotion — smooth, allocation-free animations and tweens
### Service-oriented design — clean separation of game logic, input, progression, and UI
